## My Solution to Assignments of CCS224n
This is my solution to three assignments of CS224n.
[CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) is
an interesting class, which teaches you how to do Natural Language Processing. This class provides some insights into cutting-edge researches in deep learning applied to NLP. It covers word vector representations, window-based neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long-short-term-memory models, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks as well as some recent models involving a memory component.

**Note:** If you consult my source codes that you may want to incorporate into your algorithm or system, you should clearly cite references in your codes.
